// src/ai/rl-environment.js
class IdleGameEnvironment {
  - State space: 20 dimensions (resources, buildings, rates)
  - Action space: 15 actions (collect, buy buildings, start training)
  - Reward function: Accuracy gain + efficiency + achievements
  - Episode: 1000 game ticks or achievement unlock
}
```

```javascript
// src/ai/dqn-agent.js
class DQNAgent {
  - Neural network: 64-64-32 neurons + output layer
  - Experience replay buffer (10k samples)
  - Epsilon-greedy exploration (ε = 1.0 → 0.01)
  - Target network for stable training
  - Adam optimizer (lr=0.001)
}
```

##### 2.3 Training System

##### ⚔️ Human vs AI Competition
- Side-by-side comparison
- Same starting conditions
- Score tracking:
  - Total accuracy gained
  - Time to achievements
  - Resource efficiency
- Leaderboard: Best human vs best AI

##### 💭 AI Visualization
- Real-time Q-values for each action
- Action probability distribution
- Exploration vs exploitation indicator
- Reward history graph

#### Reward Function Design
```javascript
reward = 
  + accuracy_per_second * 0.1        // Reward production
  + new_achievements * 10            // Big reward for milestones
  + efficiency_score * 5             // Reward smart resource usage
  - idle_time_penalty * 0.5          // Penalize inaction
  + building_diversity_bonus * 2     // Encourage varied strategy
```

#### Training Strategy
1. **Phase 1 (100 episodes):** Random exploration, learn basics
2. **Phase 2 (500 episodes):** Balanced exploration/exploitation
3. **Phase 3 (1000 episodes):** Fine-tune optimal strategy
4. **Phase 4 (Continuous):** Background learning from player actions
